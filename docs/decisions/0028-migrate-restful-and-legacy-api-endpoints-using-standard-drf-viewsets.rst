Migrating RESTful & Legacy Django API Endpoints to Standard DRF ViewSets
========================================================================

:Status: Proposed
:Date: 2026-03-19
:Deciders: API Working Group
:Technical Story: Open edX REST API Standards - RESTful & Legacy Django API endpoint structure standardization using DRF ViewSets

Context
-------

Many Open edX platform API endpoints are currently implemented as separate, individual
class-based or function-based (legacy) views for each HTTP action. Instead of using Django REST
Framework (DRF) ViewSets to group related operations into a single, cohesive class, each
action (list, retrieve, create, update, delete) is handled by its own standalone view.
This fragmented approach leads to significant code duplication, inconsistent behavior
across related endpoints, and an API layer that is difficult to extend or maintain.

Decision
--------

We will refactor all fragmented Open edX REST API endpoints to use DRF ViewSets,
consolidating related actions into unified, well-structured view classes.

Implementation requirements:

* All related API actions (list, retrieve, create, update, delete) **MUST** be
  consolidated into a single DRF ViewSet per resource.
* ViewSets **MUST** be registered using DRF Routers to ensure consistent, predictable
  URL patterns.
* All ViewSets **MUST** use explicit serializers for both request validation and response
  formatting (per ADR 0025).
* All ViewSets **MUST** optimize their ``get_queryset`` method using ``select_related`` 
  and ``prefetch_related`` to match the fields required by their serializers, preventing 
  N+1 query regressions.
* Multi-method handler functions (e.g., a single method handling DELETE, POST, and PUT)
  **MUST** be refactored into properly documented, action-specific methods within a
  ViewSet.
* Legacy views should be migrated to ViewSets. And **APIView** should be used for 
  non-resource endpoints where ViewSets are not a good fit.
* Backward compatibility **MUST** be maintained during migration, using
  versioned endpoints or deprecation notices. If a backwards incompatible change is
  required, that change MUST be handled by creating a new version of the API and
  transitioning to that API using the deprecation process.

Relevance in edx-platform
-------------------------

Current patterns that should be migrated:

* **Enrollment API** (``/api/enrollment/v1/``) - currently split across three
  independent ``APIView`` classes, each handling a distinct part of the enrollment
  resource:

  * ``EnrollmentListView(APIView, ApiKeyPermissionMixIn)`` - handles
    ``GET /api/enrollment/v1/enrollment`` (list all enrollments for the current user)
    and ``POST /api/enrollment/v1/enrollment`` (enroll a user in a course, with support
    for mode, enrollment attributes, and enterprise consent).
  * ``UnenrollmentView(APIView)`` - handles
    ``POST /api/enrollment/v1/unenrollment``, a privileged service-only endpoint that
    unenrolls a single user from all courses as part of the user retirement pipeline.
  * ``EnrollmentAllowedView(APIView)`` - handles retrieval and creation of
    ``CourseEnrollmentAllowed`` records for a given user email and course ID; restricted
    to admin users via ``permissions.IsAdminUser``.
  * These three views operate on the same enrollment resource and should be unified into
    a single ``EnrollmentViewSet``.

* **Assets Handling Endpoints** - currently exhibit a distinct issue:

  * A single handler function mixes DELETE, POST, and PUT operations without clear
    separation of concerns.
  * **Resolution:** Refactor into a properly documented ``AssetsViewSet`` with distinct
    action methods.

* **Legacy Django Views** - Many endpoints still use plain Django views instead of DRF:
  * Hard-coded JSON responses using ``HttpResponse(json.dumps(...))`` instead of serializers
  * Manual method dispatch instead of DRF mixins and ViewSets
  * Missing DRF features like automatic authentication, permission classes, and schema generation
  * Inconsistent error handling and response formats

Illustrative Example
--------------------

The following shows the structural pattern being replaced and the target pattern.
Full implementation details will be addressed during the migration of each endpoint.

**Before - Enrollment API (current fragmented pattern):**

.. code-block:: python

    # Three separate APIView classes for one logical resource
    class EnrollmentListView(APIView, ApiKeyPermissionMixIn): ...
    class UnenrollmentView(APIView): ...         # privileged, retirement pipeline only
    class EnrollmentAllowedView(APIView): ...    # admin-only, CourseEnrollmentAllowed records

**After - Consolidated into a single ViewSet:**

.. code-block:: python

    class EnrollmentViewSet(viewsets.ViewSet):
        # viewsets.ViewSet used intentionally — enrollment logic routes through
        # the api module, not direct ORM, so ModelViewSet is not appropriate.

        def list(self, request): ...
        def create(self, request): ...

        @action(detail=False, methods=["post"], url_path="unenrollment",
                permission_classes=[ApiKeyHeaderPermission])
        def unenroll(self, request): ...         # preserves privileged-only restriction

        @action(detail=False, methods=["get", "post"], url_path="allowed",
                permission_classes=[permissions.IsAdminUser],
                throttle_classes=[EnrollmentUserThrottle])
        def allowed(self, request): ...          # reuses existing CourseEnrollmentAllowedSerializer

    router = DefaultRouter()
    router.register(r"enrollment", EnrollmentViewSet, basename="enrollment")

**Before - Assets handler (current pattern):**

.. code-block:: python

    # Single function-based view with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE all dispatched
    # inside handle_assets().
    @login_required
    @ensure_csrf_cookie
    def assets_handler(request, course_key_string=None, asset_key_string=None):
        return handle_assets(request, course_key_string, asset_key_string)

**After - Dedicated ViewSet:**

.. code-block:: python

    class AssetsViewSet(viewsets.ViewSet):
        # Reuses existing asset_storage_handlers service functions.
        def list(self, request, course_key_string): ...     # GET  - paginated asset list
        def create(self, request, course_key_string): ...   # POST - upload asset
        def update(self, request, course_key_string, pk): ... # PUT  - update lock state
        def destroy(self, request, course_key_string, pk): ...# DELETE - remove asset

Consequences
------------

Positive
~~~~~~~~

* Consistent, discoverable API structure that is easier for developers and third-party
  integrators to understand and consume.
* Significant reduction in code duplication by consolidating related operations into a
  single ViewSet class.
* Improved maintainability - changes to a resource's API logic are localized to one
  ViewSet rather than scattered across multiple view files.
* DRF Routers automatically generate standard URL patterns, reducing manual URL
  configuration and human error.
* Improved compatibility with AI systems, automated testing frameworks, and third-party
  integrations that expect predictable, standardized responses.
* Enables automatic API schema generation and documentation via ``drf-spectacular``.

Negative / Trade-offs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Refactoring existing fragmented views into ViewSets requires non-trivial upfront
  development effort.
* Existing URL patterns may change during migration, requiring updates to client-side
  code, documentation, and any hardcoded references.
* Teams unfamiliar with DRF ViewSets and Routers will require onboarding before
  contributing to migrated endpoints.

Alternatives Considered
-----------------------

* **Keep fragmented APIView classes:** Rejected. Maintains code duplication,
  inconsistency, and high maintenance burden across related operations.
* **Use DRF GenericAPIView with mixins:** Partially considered but rejected as the
  primary approach. While mixins reduce some duplication, they do not provide the same
  level of structural consolidation or URL standardization as ViewSets with routers.

Rollout Plan
------------

1. Audit existing API endpoints to identify all fragmented view patterns and legacy Django
   views.
2. Prioritize high-impact resources for migration: Enrollment API, Assets endpoints, and
   any other endpoints identified in the audit.
3. Refactor identified endpoints into DRF ViewSets, registered via DRF Routers. Ensure
   all ViewSets use explicit serializers per ADR 0025.
4. Include a comparison of SQL query counts to ensure no performance degradation.
5. Update and expand test coverage to validate correct behavior of all refactored
   ViewSet actions.
6. Publish deprecation notices for any legacy URL patterns that will be replaced,
   providing clear migration guidance to internal and external API consumers.
7. Update API documentation to reflect the new ViewSet-based structure and URL patterns.

"""
Celery tasks for Content Libraries.

Architecture note:

    Several functions in this file manage the copying/updating of blocks in modulestore
    and openedx_content. These operations should only be performed within the context of CMS.
    However, due to existing edx-platform code structure, we've had to define the functions
    in shared source tree (openedx/) and the tasks are registered in both LMS and CMS.

    To ensure that we're not accidentally importing things from openedx_content in the LMS context,
    we use ensure_cms throughout this module.

    A longer-term solution to this issue would be to move the content_libraries app to cms:
